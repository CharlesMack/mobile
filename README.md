Installation
P.O.P.S. is a web-based application that requires no installation for end users. To run or develop locally, follow these steps:
Prerequisites

A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox).
A local web server (e.g., live-server, Python's http.server, or Node.js) for development to handle CORS and local testing.
Git for cloning the repository.

Steps

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/charlesmack/mobile.git
cd mobile


Serve the Application:

Using Node.js with live-server:npm install -g live-server
live-server


Using Python:python -m http.server 8000


Open your browser to http://localhost:8000 (or the port provided by your server).


Verify CORS for AppDrops:

AppDrops load from external URLs (e.g., https://charlesmack.github.io/OnePagerMiniOS/appdrops/...). Ensure these URLs are accessible and configured for CORS to load in iframes.



Usage

Launch P.O.P.S.:

Open the application in a browser via the live demo or local server.
The home screen displays a grid of AppDrop tiles.


Interact with AppDrops:

Tap a tile (e.g., DJ Drop üéß) to open it in a draggable, resizable panel.
Use the dock or app switcher (üì±) to navigate between open apps.
Minimize (‚Äì) or close (‚úï) panels, or open apps in a new tab (‚ÜóÔ∏è).


Customize the Interface:

Enter edit mode by long-pressing a tile or right-clicking to drag and reorder apps.
Click "A‚ÜíZ Sort" in edit mode to alphabetize tiles.
Open the Settings panel (‚öôÔ∏è) to change the theme color via swatches or the color picker. Click "Reset to Default" to revert to the green theme (#00ff7f).


Multitask:

Open multiple AppDrops and use the app switcher to switch between or close them.
Drag panels to reposition them on the screen.

Issues and Feedback
Report bugs or suggest features via the Issues tab. Include details like browser, device, and steps to reproduce for bugs.
Limitations

Internet Dependency: AppDrops require an internet connection. Offline support is not implemented (consider adding a Service Worker).
CORS: External AppDrop URLs must support CORS to load in iframes.
Accessibility: Limited keyboard navigation and ARIA support; enhancements are needed for screen readers.
Scalability: The grid may become crowded with many AppDrops; consider pagination or folders for future iterations.

Roadmap

Add offline support using Service Workers.
Implement notifications for AppDrop updates or alerts.
Enhance accessibility with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.
Allow users to add custom AppDrops via a settings interface.
Optimize performance for low-end devices with metrics for iframe load times.
